# Presentations

This is a repo for any presentations I happen to do. All presentations use TPP (https://github.com/cbbrowne/tpp), as I'm not a fan of anything else for presenting. And its simple. Give it a look, its pretty cool.

## Opening and viewing a presentation

First, install TPP, then just run `tpp presentation.tpp` in your terminal. Done.
